# ThreadSight-Mobile-AR-Clothing-Try-On-App
ThreadSight is an iOS-based augmented reality (AR) virtual try-on application developed in Unity for the Startup Pitch category at Infomatrix Asia 2026.

*Project Overview*

ThreadSight addresses one of the most critical challenges in online fashion retail: high return rates caused by size and fit uncertainty. Customers often hesitate to purchase clothing online because they cannot accurately visualize how garments will look or fit on their own body. This leads to 30–40% return rates in fashion e-commerce, creating financial loss and environmental impact.
ThreadSight transforms the smartphone into a real-time digital fitting room.

*Technical Implementation*

The MVP is built in Unity (iOS platform) using AR and body tracking technologies. The system:
Detects the human body through real-time camera input
Tracks body joints and proportions
Maps 3D clothing models (T-shirt, hoodie, shoes) onto the user
Adjusts garment positioning dynamically based on movement

The application demonstrates:

Real-time garment overlay

Live body tracking

Mobile performance optimization

iOS compatibility

*Innovation*

Unlike many enterprise-level AR retail systems that require expensive infrastructure, ThreadSight is designed to be lightweight, scalable, and accessible for small and medium fashion brands.
The project combines:
Computer vision
Augmented reality
3D garment modeling
Business-oriented SaaS thinking
Business Perspective

*ThreadSight is positioned as a B2B SaaS solution for fashion brands and e-commerce platforms.*

Potential revenue streams include:
Monthly subscription for brands
API integration
Per-garment 3D digitization service
White-label enterprise licensing
Competition Context

*Developed specifically for the Startup Pitch category at Infomatrix Asia 2026, ThreadSight demonstrates:*

Problem identification
Market research
Technical feasibility (functional MVP)
Scalable business model

*Entrepreneurial mindset*

ThreadSight represents the future of digital fashion retail — reducing returns, increasing customer confidence, and bringing the fitting room experience into the era of augmented reality.
